# CVE ID
CVE-2024-30737

# Title
Remote Command Execution Vulnerability in ROS Kinetic Kame

# Vulnerability Type
Remote Command Execution

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS Kinetic Kame (ROS_VERSION=1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
A critical vulnerability has been identified in ROS Kinetic Kame, particularly in configurations with ROS_VERSION=1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3. The affected components, including packages or nodes within the ROS system, are vulnerable to remote command execution attacks. This flaw could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system from remote locations, potentially leading to unauthorized system control, data breaches, system and network compromise, operational disruption, and the introduction of malware or ransomware, thereby posing significant safety risks.

# Impact
The exploitation of this vulnerability grants attackers the capability to remotely execute commands on affected ROS nodes or packages. This can lead to a wide range of adverse impacts, including unauthorized system control, privacy violations, system and network compromise, operational disruptions, and the introduction of malicious software. The severity and extent of the impact depend on the nature of the executed commands and the roles and permissions of the compromised nodes or packages.

# Attack Vector
This vulnerability can be exploited through various methods, including exploiting network protocols, phishing or social engineering tactics, malicious code injection, and compromised application interfaces. Attackers might use these methods to deliver and execute malicious commands or scripts within the ROS environment.

# Solution
It is strongly recommended that users of ROS Kinetic Kame immediately update to the latest version of the software, where this vulnerability has been addressed. Developers and system administrators should also review and strengthen the security of their network protocols and application interfaces to prevent exploitation.

# Workaround
Until a patch can be applied, users should minimize the risk of exploitation by closely monitoring and filtering incoming network traffic, implementing strict access controls, and regularly auditing the security of application interfaces. Employing network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and application layer firewalls may also help detect and block attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
